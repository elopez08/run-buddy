<!--Look more into "nav" tool.  This is what caused the site not to work when it was just the header.
What happenered was that when I applied the CSS sheet onto the code with just having nav around the title, the others that involved the list did not get affected by it for some reason.  But by doing that and I put the nav closing at the end of the ul, the style applied

There was a line that had href="#what-we-do".  The symbol with the # shows as a placeholder for the privacy page that doesn't exist yet.
